# NumPadCalc
NumPadCalc is intended to be used with full keyboard (with numeric keys) and being easily launched with hotkey "Pause" or "NumLock".
The Calculator was mainly tested on Windows. Hotkey support on MacOS is different, but also possible. Default hotkey for MacOS is F13. It is also possible to set the hotkey to "Clear" button (placed where NumLock on Windows).
Using Pyinstaller it is possible to compile an executible file for standalone operation. Precompiled executable is already available from this repository.
I will be happy if this Calculator helps someone in his daily work !
