# NumPadCalc
NumPadCalc is intended to be used with full keyboard (with numeric keys) and being easily launched with hotkey "Pause" or "NumLock".
The Calculator was mainly tested on Windows.
The NumPadCalc supports all Python Math functions. Some additional information can be found in Help of the NumPadCalc.
Using Pyinstaller it is possible to compile an executible file for standalone operation. Precompiled executable is already available from this repository.
I will be happy if this Calculator helps someone in his daily work !

# Known bugs / weaknesses
It is planned that the Calculator will be called using NumLock key (preferable hotkey of author ;). Each time when NumLock key is hit, NumPadCalc pops up and numeric keyboard should be kept in numeric mode. This is not implemented yet.

# Hotkey support under MacOS
Hotkey support on MacOS is different, but also possible. Default hotkey for MacOS is F13. It is also possible to set the hotkey to "Clear" button (the same position as NumLock on Windows).
