# NumPadCalc
NumPadCalc is intended to be used with full keyboard (with numeric keys) and being easyly launched with hotkey "Pause" or "NumLock".
The Calculator was mainly tested on Windows. Hotkey support on MacOS is different, but also possible.
Using pyinstaller it is possible to compile an executible file for standalone operation.
I will be happy if this Calculator helps someone in his daily work !
